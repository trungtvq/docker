This repo use TXT to get certificate, if you dont have it, so this project is useless for you.
Run cmd:
	docker run --rm -iv${PWD}:/exports trungtvq/cert

Then if success in taking certificate, it will lie in new folder live in current dir.
Use it well.

This directory contains your keys and certificates.

`privkey.pem`  : the private key for your certificate.
`fullchain.pem`: the certificate file used in most server software.
`chain.pem`    : used for OCSP stapling in Nginx >=1.3.7.
`cert.pem`     : will break many server configurations, and should not be used
                 without reading further documentation (see link below).
